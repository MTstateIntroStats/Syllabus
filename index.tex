\section{Course description}\label{course-description}

Stat 216 is designed to engage you in the statistical investigation
process from developing a research question and data collection methods
to analyzing and communicating results. This course introduces basic
descriptive and inferential statistics using both traditional (normal
and \(t\)-distribution) and simulation approaches including confidence
intervals and hypothesis testing on means (one-sample, two-sample,
paired), proportions (one-sample, two-sample), regression and
correlation. You will be exposed to numerous examples of real-world
applications of statistics that are designed to help you develop a
conceptual understanding of statistics. After taking this course, you
should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Understand and appreciate how statistics affects your daily life and
  the fundamental role of statistics in all disciplines.
\item
  Evaluate statistics and statistical studies you encounter in your
  other courses.
\item
  Critically read news stories based on statistical studies as an
  informed consumer of data.
\item
  Assess the role of randomness and variability in different contexts.
\item
  Use basic methods to conduct and analyze statistical studies using
  statistical software.
\item
  Evaluate and communicate answers to the four pillars of statistical
  inference: How strong is the evidence of an effect? What is the size
  of the effect? How broadly do the conclusions apply? Can we say what
  caused the observed difference?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{MUS STAT 216 learning
outcomes}\label{mus-stat-216-learning-outcomes}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Understand how to describe the characteristics of a distribution.
\item
  Understand how data can be collected, and how data collection dictates
  the choice of statistical method and appropriate statistical
  inference.
\item
  Interpret and communicate the outcomes of estimation and hypothesis
  tests in the context of a problem.
\item
  To understand the scope of inference for a given dataset.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{CORE 2.0}\label{core-2.0}

This course fulfills the Quantitative Reasoning (Q) CORE 2.0 requirement
because learning probability and statistics allows us to disentangle
what's really happening in nature from ``noise'' inherent in data
collection. It allows us to evaluate claims from advertisements and
results of polls and builds critical thinking skills which form the
basis of statistical inference. Students completing a Core 2.0
Quantitative Reasoning (Q) course should demonstrate an ability to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Interpret and draw inferences from mathematical models such as
  formulas, graphs, diagrams or tables.
\item
  Represent mathematical information numerically, symbolically and
  visually.
\item
  Employ quantitative methods in symbolic systems such as, arithmetic,
  algebra, or geometry to solve problems.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\section{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}

Entrance to STAT 216 requires at least one of the following be met:

  During class meetings, students will \textbf{complete} activities and
  labs in assigned groups with the assistance of the teaching team.
\item
  Per the \href{calendars/F25-Stat216_Calendar.pdf}{STAT 216 calendar},
  the course will be broken down into modules and units.
\item
  To begin each module, students will

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{read} assigned sections of the online textbook on that
    topic's content.
  \item
    \textbf{watch} assigned videos on Canvas and complete the video
    notes located in the Stat 216 coursepack \textbf{(video note
    completion is checked in class)}

    \emph{OPTIONAL}: students may complete \textbf{video/reading}
    quizzes on Gradescope to check their understanding at any point
    during a module.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Activities} will take place during class in assigned teams
  with the assistance of the instruction team. Select problems from the
  activity will be turned into Gradescope before class ends.
\item
  After all activities within a module have been completed, students
  will complete a \textbf{Module Lab} during class time. The lab will
  serve as a review of key concepts from the module. Select problems
  from the lab will be turned into Gradescope before class ends.
\item
  After all modules within a unit are complete, students will complete a
  \textbf{Midterm Exam} over the topics covered.
\item
  Students will also complete one \textbf{assignment} in
  \href{https://www.gradescope.com/}{Gradescope} per week, typically due
  on Mondays.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\section{Course assessment}\label{course-assessment}

Your grade in STAT 216 will contain the following components.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{index_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-1-1} \end{center}

\subsubsection{Preparation (10\%)}\label{preparation-10}

To begin each module, you will be expected to complete the assigned
textbook reading, watch the assigned videos in Canvas and take complete
guided notes on the videos prior to class. Guided video notes are found
in the coursepack and will be checked off at the start of class the
first day of the new module.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Guided video notes, found in the coursepack purchased from the MSU
  Bookstore, will be \textbf{checked for completion at the start of
  class the first day of a new module}.
\item
  OPTIONAL: You can complete video/reading quizzes, which are found on
  Gradescope, to check your understanding at any point during a module.
  You can check your answers after each question by using the Save
  button. If an explanation appears after you have saved your answer,
  that indicates your answer was correct.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Engagement (10\%)}\label{engagement-10}

Every class day, you will meet with your classmates and instructor team
to work through that day's coursepack group activity. Exit tickets
(reviewing select questions from the activity) grades make up this
portion of your grade.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Activities must be completed in the Stat 216 Coursepack. \textbf{If
  you prefer to complete the activity on a pdf copy using a
  stylus-enabled device, please speak to your instructor, and he or she
  will provide you with a PDF copy of the coursepack.}
\item
  As a group, you will submit an `exit ticket' (answers to select
  question(s) from the activity) to \textbf{Gradescope at the end of
  each class period}.
\item
  Policy for missed activities/exit tickets:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We will not record or post lectures/asynchronous learning
    opportunities.
  \item
    Students get a ``free pass'' for up to three activities/exit tickets
    per Unit, no questions asked, \emph{but students are expected to
    communicate any absences with their section instructor}.
    Illnesses/emergencies/school-related absences are included in these
    three; if students have extraneous circumstances, they are
    encouraged to talk to their instructor.
  \item
    For illnesses or when students cannot attend class, we recommend
    that the student video conference into class with their group.
    Students attending class remotely can show their activity via video
    conference for credit. Video conferencing should be set up by
    students' teammates. If the student is uncomfortable asking, the
    instructor can facilitate that conversation (e.g., email the
    students' teammates, cc'ing the student, and ask if anyone can setup
    a WebEx meeting for class).
  \item
    Students who are unable to attend class remotely AND e-mail their
    instructor \textbf{the day of the missed class} regarding an absence
    will be allowed a 24-hour extension to complete the exit ticket.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The three (3) lowest exit ticket grades EACH unit will be dropped.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Module Labs (15\%)}\label{module-labs-15}

After a module has been completed, you will meet with your classmates

lab will reinforce the topics learned in the activities but with the use
of RStudio for exploring and analyzing data.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Each group will turn in selected questions from the lab to Gradescope.
  Labs are due \textbf{at 9 pm Mountain Time on dates indicated on the
  course calendar}.
\item
  The lowest (1) lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.
\item
  Each student will also have the lab checked for completion at the
  \textbf{beginning of the following class period} for that class
  period's Engagement grade.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assignments (15\%)}\label{assignments-15}

You will complete weekly assignments in
\href{https://www.gradescope.com/}{Gradescope}. These should be
completed individually (meaning all answers should be written in your
own words), but you may use your classmates, tutors, or your
instructor/co-instructor/TA for assistance.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Weekly assignments are due \textbf{Monday at 9pm Mountain Time each
  week, covering the previous week's content}.

\section{Late work policies}\label{late-work-policies}

Note: we \textbf{highly} recommend saving your answers for each question
while you complete all work in Gradescope. This will ensure you can
return to labs, exit tickets, or assignments at a later date without
fear of losing any progress. Additionally, Gradescope will automatically
submit any saved work when the due date passes, ensuring you earn up to
full credit for all problems completed on time.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Assignments}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For assignments, while the due dates are 9 pm on Mondays, you will
    be allowed to turn in work until 11:59 pm on the due date.
    Assignment submissions that are received between 9 pm and 11:59 pm
    will receive a 5\% grade deduction. Extensions on assignments are
    not given unless extenuating circumstances are present which are
    communicated to the Student Success Coordinator,
    \href{jade.schmidt2@montana.edu}{Jade Schmidt}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Exit Tickets and Labs}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You may take the exit tickets and labs in Gradescope as many times
    as you like up until the due date using the Resubmit button to
    re-open an assessment.
  \item
    If you miss class and email your section instructor about your
    absence \textbf{the day class is missed}, you will be given a
    24-hour extension to complete the exit ticket or lab.
  \item
    If possible, it is highly recommended to attend class virtually (via
    video conferencing with your group) to complete the lab or exit
    ticket with your team.\\
  \item
    Further extensions on exit tickets or labs, or when an absence is
    not communicated prior to class time, are not given unless
    extenuating circumstances are present. Please email the Student
    Success Coordinator, \href{jade.schmidt2@montana.edu}{Jade Schmidt}
    if you feel your missed exit ticket or lab falls into this category.
  \item
    For labs, while the due dates are 9 pm on the day the lab is
    completed in class, you will be allowed to turn in work until 11:59
    pm on the due date. Lab submissions that are received between 9 pm
    and 11:59 pm will receive a 5\% grade deduction.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Exams}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Students that are in quarantine but healthy enough to take the exam
    should email Student Success Coordinator
    \href{mailto:\%20jade.schmidt2@montana.edu}{Jade Schmidt} to make
    alternative arrangements. The group exams may be taken remotely and
    proctored via WebEx but all individual exams must be taken in
    person.
  \item
    If you are ill to the point of not being able to take the exam,
    please email Student Success Coordinator
    \href{mailto:\%20jade.schmidt2@montana.edu}{Jade Schmidt} to make
    alternative arrangements.\\
  \item
    Students who miss the exam without contacting the instructor prior
    to the exam will receive a zero on the exam.
  \item
    Work is not a legitimate reason for an exam absence.
  \end{itemize}

\section{COVID-19 policies and health-related class
absences}\label{covid-19-policies-and-health-related-class-absences}

Face masks are recommended, but not required, for students, faculty and
staff indoors on campus.

Please evaluate your own health status regularly and refrain from
attending class and other on-campus events if you are ill.~MSU students
who miss class due to illness will be given opportunities to access
course materials online. You are encouraged to seek appropriate medical
attention for treatment of illness. In the event of contagious illness,
please do not come to class or to campus to turn in work. Instead notify
us by email about your absence as soon as practical, so that
accommodations can be made. Please note that documentation (a Doctor's
note) for medical excuses is not required. MSU University Health
Partners--as part their commitment to maintain patient confidentiality,
to encourage more appropriate use of healthcare resources, and to
support meaningful dialogue between instructors and students--does not
provide such documentation.

\section{Diversity and inclusivity}\label{diversity-and-inclusivity}

Respect for Diversity: It is our intent that students from all diverse
backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that
students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that
the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource,
strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and
activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexual
orientation, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race,
religion, culture, perspective, and other background characteristics.
Your suggestions about how to improve the value of diversity in this
course are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to
improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other
students or student groups.

In addition, in scheduling exams, we have attempted to avoid conflicts
with major religious holidays. If, however, we have inadvertently
scheduled an exam or major deadline that creates a conflict with your
religious observances, please let us know as soon as possible so that we
can make other arrangements.

Support for Inclusivity: We support an inclusive learning environment
where diversity and individual differences are understood, respected,
appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. We expect that
students, faculty, administrators and staff at MSU will respect
differences and demonstrate diligence in understanding how other
peoples' perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews may be different from
their own.

\section{Policy on academic
misconduct}\label{policy-on-academic-misconduct}

Students in an academic setting are responsible for approaching all
assignments with rigor, integrity, and in compliance with the University
Code of Student Conduct. This responsibility includes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  consulting and analyzing sources that are relevant to the topic of
  inquiry;
\item
  clearly acknowledging when they draw from the ideas or the phrasing of
  those sources in their own writing;
\item
  learning and using appropriate citation conventions within the field
  in which they are studying; and
\item
  asking their instructor for guidance when they are uncertain of how to
  acknowledge the contributions of others in their thinking and writing.
\end{enumerate}

When students fail to adhere to these responsibilities, they may
intentionally or unintentionally ``use someone else's language, ideas,
or other original (not common-knowledge) material without properly
acknowledging its source'' \url{http://www.wpacouncil.org}. When the act
is intentional, the student has engaged in plagiarism.

Plagiarism is an act of academic misconduct, which carries with it
consequences including, but not limited to, receiving a course grade of
``F'' and a report to the Office of the Dean of Students. Unfortunately,
it is not always clear if the misuse of sources is intentional or
unintentional, which means that you may be accused of plagiarism even if
you do not intentionally plagiarize. If you have any questions regarding
use and citation of sources in your academic writing, you are
responsible for consulting with your instructor before the assignment
due date. In addition, you can work with an MSU Writing Center tutor at
any point in your writing process, including when you are integrating or
citing sources. You can make an appointment and find citation resources
at www.montana.edu/writingcenter.

\textbf{ In STAT 216, assignments that include the same wording as
another student, regardless of whether that student was cited in your
sources, will be considered plagiarism and will be treated as such.
Students involved in plagiarism on assignments (all parties involved)
will receive a zero grade on that assignment. The second offense will
result in a zero on that assignment, and the incident will be reported
to the Dean of Students. Academic misconduct on an exam will result in a
zero on that exam and will be reported to the Dean of Students, without
exception.}

\section{Policy on intellectual
property}\label{policy-on-intellectual-property}

This syllabus, course lectures and presentations, and any course
materials provided throughout this term are protected by U.S. copyright
laws. Students enrolled in the course may use them for their own
research and educational purposes. However, reproducing, selling or

\section{Policy on the use of AI language models}\label{AI}

In this course, you may utilize generative AI language models, including
ChatGPT, as a resource to support your work outside of class (during
class, you should seek assistance from group members or instructors). AI
language models are powerful tools developed to generate text based on
the input provided. \textbf{While the AI language models can help refine
your writing and coding, it is important to remember that it is an AI
system and not a substitute for your critical thinking and creativity.
Due to the nature of statistics and this course, an AI-generated answer
may be incomplete, overly complex, or even incorrect.} If you do not
understand a concept or a question asked, we \emph{highly} recommend
visiting the \href{https://math.montana.edu/undergrad/msc/}{Math and
Stats Center}, emailing or visiting with a member of your instructional
team, or using the search feature within the online textbook before
turning to Google or AI.

If you choose to use this tool, apply it as a supplement and do not rely
solely on its suggestions. Ultimately, you are responsible for the
content and quality of your work. Therefore, you should critically
evaluate ChatGPT outputs for accuracy, potential bias, and relevancy.
When utilizing AI language models, it is essential to ensure that your
writing and coding remains original and properly attributed, including
citing outputs or text generated by ChatGPT. \textbf{If you choose to
use AI language models to assist you on labs or assignments, you must
cite the source used. Failure to do so will result in earning a 0 on all
problems in which AI language models usage has been detected.}

Please see the How to cite ChatGPT in MLA Style
\href{https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/}{resource}. We
encourage you to use AI language models to enhance your writing and
coding skills, experiment with its capabilities, and learn from its
suggestions. If you have any questions or concerns regarding using AI
language models for assignments, please discuss them with us.
